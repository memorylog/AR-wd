            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>Augmented reality animated content in classroom lessons could catch students’ attention in our dynamic day and age, as well as motivate them to study.  Adding extra data, e.g. fun facts, historical data about sites or events, visual 3D models, would give students a wider understanding of topics.<br><br><b>Example: </b> Elements 4D where using the paper or wood blocks and they can combine two elements together to see a presentation of the chemical reaction that occurs when they are combined in nature.

            <h3>Medical</h3>
            <p>Medical students use AR technology to practice and train in a controlled environment. Visualizations aid in explaining complex medical conditions to patients. Augmented reality can reduce the risk of an operation by giving the surgeon improved sensory perception. <br><br><b>Example: </b> AccuVein used to locate veins and display the arrangement of blood vessels on the surface of the skin.</p><br> <br><br><br>

            <h3>Retail</h3>
            <p>Retail stores use AR technology that can provide a level of interaction between their retail products and consumers. AR allows customer to experience products and services right in their homes instead of visiting the store.<br><br><b>Example: </b> IKEA Place lets customers virtually ‘place’ furnishings in their space. The furnishings in the app are 3D and true to scale so customers can make sure it’s just the right size, design and functionality for their room.<br><br><br><br></p>

            <h3>Tourism</h3>
            <p>The mobile device has also allowed users to embrace augmented reality in the tourism industry.  A smartphone with a camera gives tourists the ability to walk through historic sites and see facts and figures presented as an overlay on their live screen. These applications use GPS and image recognition technology to look up data from an online database.<br><br><b>Example: </b>  The app made for an exhibition in National Museum of Singapore combined  the camera function on their phones, to hunt for and capture various plants and animals within the drawings. tells you what’s nearby and adds it to a photo collection once you’ve captured it. More trivia is given about plant or animal captured where users learn things about general information about the species.<br></p>

            <h3>Construction</h3>
            <p>Augmented reality in construction and architecture projects involves placing a 3D model of a proposed design onto an existing space using mobile devices and 3D models. This can help users recognizes the design, and the screen overlays a virtual model of what the project will look like upon completion.<br><br><b>Example: </b> SmartReality can place a 3D model in context, viewable on an iOS or Android device, whether on a 2D set of plans, in front of an actual site</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>AR gaming is the integration of game visual and audio content with the user’s environment in real time. AR gaming has a more immersive as it merges the digital environment into the real world.<br><br><b>Example: </b> Pokemon Go which uses smartphone's camera, gyroscope, clock and GPS and to enable a location-based augmented reality environment.</p>
